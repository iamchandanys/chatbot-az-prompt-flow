        - name: submit_inspection
          description:
            This function is used to submit a completed car inspection process
            for users who have purchased or renewed a car insurance policy. It
            accepts images of the car's front, back, left, and right sides, along
            with the extracted car number, to finalize and log the inspection
            process. The images are analyzed for clarity and potential damages,
            which are reported in the inspection summary. The function ensures the
            inspection process is systematic, accurate, and ready for review by the
            insurance company.
